## Employment Rents

.pull-left[
- Cost of loosing a job

 - The difference between value of job and the next best option

- Depends on  
 - wage, medical benefits, ... 
 - disutility of work (function of effort),
 - unemployment benefits (if exists)
 - duration of potential unemployment
 - stigma of unemployment,
 - other available employment opportunities  

- Reservation wage = value of next best option

- Employment rent = wage - reservation wage - distutility of effort

Employment rent = $(12-2-6) \times 35 \times 44 = 6160$

## Worker's best response

.pull-left[
- For a given wage offered, the optimal effort exerted by the workers

- Say wage rate = $12
 - Why would'nt a worker exert more effort than .5?
 - Why would'nt a worker exert less effort than .5?
 
- Feasible set: 

 - Wage and effort pairs that a firm can get from its employees

- Slope of the best response curve = MRT
 - MRT stands for marginal rate of transformation

## Shape of worker's best response

.pull-left[
- Effort at the reservation wage is 0

- Effort is increasing in wage

- Best response function is concave

 - Firms need to increase wage rate more to induce more effort from workers if the initial wage is higher

- For more detail read [Leibniz: The workerâ€™s best response function](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/leibniz-06-06-01.html)

Questions:

- What happens to the best response curve if 

 - unemployment duration increases,
 
 - unemployment benefit decreases?

## Firm's best response

- A firm's goal is to maximize profits

 - Maximize production
 
 - Minimize cost
 
- To maximize production, offer higher wages

 - $\Uparrow$ wages $\Rightarrow$ $\Uparrow$ effort $\Rightarrow$ $\Uparrow$ production

- To minimize cost, offer lower wages

- Trade-off between wages and effort

## Isocost lines

.pull-left[

#### How to deal with the wage effort trade-off?

- Minimize cost of effort (effort/wage)

- Cost of effort is the same at all points on an isocost line

## Determination of wages

.pull-left[
- Profits are maximized at the steepest isocost line at the minimum feasible cost
 
 - Equilibrium wage and effort is point A, where MRS = MRT

- Efficiency wage: a wage rate greater than the reservation wage rate
