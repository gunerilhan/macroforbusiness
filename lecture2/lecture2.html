### Wage setting decision

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

"Labor discipline model" is a theory that characterizes the wage setting process.

# Labor Discipline Model

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
### Labor discipline model

- Workers have employment rents

 - loosing a job is costly
 
- Workers exert more effort if the cost of loosing a job is higher

 - The higher the wage, the costlier to lose a job
 
 - Exerting more effort is not desirable (disutility of work)
 
- Workers optimally decide on how much effort to put on

- Firms have a trade-off:

 - Higher wages induce more effort from workers leading to more production, increasing profitability
 
 - Wage bill is a substantial portion of production costs, reducing profitability
 
- Firms optimally choose a wage rate to maximize profits 

---
### Employment Rents


.pull-left[
[Read section 6.5 Determinants of the employment rent](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/06.html#65-determinants-of-the-employment-rent)


- Cost of loosing a job

 - The difference between value of job and the next best option

- Depends on  
 - wage, medical benefits, ... 
 - disutility of work (function of effort),
 - unemployment benefits (if exists)
 - duration of potential unemployment
 - stigma of unemployment,
 - other available employment opportunities  

- Reservation wage = value of next best option

- Employment rent = wage - reservation wage - distutility of effort
]

.pull-right[

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./lecture2_files/figure-html/Slide4.JPG" width="100%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Employment rent = `\((12-6-2)\times 35 \times 44 = 6160\)`

### Worker's best response

.pull-left[
- For a given wage offered, the optimal effort exerted by the workers

- Say wage rate = $12
 - Why wouldn't a worker exert more effort than .5?
 - Why wouldn't a worker exert less effort than .5?
 
- Feasible set: 

 - Wage and effort pairs that a firm can get from its employees

- Slope of the best response curve = MRT
 - MRT stands for marginal rate of transformation of wages into effort

&lt;img src="./lecture2_files/figure-html/Slide5.JPG" width="100%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

---

### Shape of worker's best response

.pull-left[
- Effort at the reservation wage is 0

- Effort is increasing in wage

- Best response function is concave

 - Firms need to increase wage rate more to induce more effort from workers if the initial wage is higher

- For more detail read [Leibniz: The worker’s best response function](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/leibniz-06-06-01.html)

Questions:

- What happens to the best response curve if 

 - unemployment duration increases,
 
 - unemployment benefit decreases?

## Firm's best response

- A firm's goal is to maximize profits

 - by maximizing production
 
 - by minimizing cost of production (wage bill included)
 
- To maximize production, offer higher wages

 - `\(\Uparrow\)` wages `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\Uparrow\)` effort `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\Uparrow\)` production

- To minimize cost, offer lower wages

- Trade-off between wages and effort
---
## Isocost lines

.pull-left[

#### How to deal with the wage effort trade-off?

- Minimize cost of effort (wage/effort)

- Cost of effort is the same at all points on an isocost line

### Determination of wages

.pull-left[
- Profits are maximized at the steepest isocost line (the minimum feasible cost)
 
 - Equilibrium wage and effort is point A, where MRS = MRT

- Efficiency wage: a wage rate greater than the reservation wage rate

 - What matters for profits is `\(e/w\)`, the efficiency per dollar of wage costs.

### Involuntary unemployment

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "The state of being out of work, but preferring to have a job at the wages and working conditions that otherwise identical employed workers have."
&gt; &amp;ndash; Core the Economy

&lt;br&gt;

- In this model, there must be involuntary unemployment

- Suppose there is no involuntary unemployment

- Workers will not exert any effort

- Employers will not make any payment to workers who don't work



---

.pull-left[
### Position of workers' best response curve

The position of the best response curve depends on 

- the utility from consumption enabled by the wage income

- disutility of effort

- the probability of being caught while slacking

- the duration of potential unemployment

- the reservation wage

 - depends on the level of unemployment
 
- Higher unemployment rate
 - lower unemployment benefits
 
 - higher duration of unemployment benefits

### Relevance of the previous section

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- Previous section was a firm level analysis.

- We assumed unemployment rate is given in our analyis.

- In the coming weeks, we will analyze the determination of unemployment rate in the economy relying on what we have learned.

### Pricing and production decisions

- Relevant for firms selling differentiated products or firms with market power

&gt; "An attribute of a firm that can sell its product at a range of feasible prices, so that it can benefit by acting as a price-setter (rather than a price-taker)." &amp;ndash; Core the Economy


 
- Depends on

 - firm cost structure

 - Market demand
 
- Analyze pricing and production decisions in 4 steps

 1. Represent cost structure as cost function
 
 2. Using the cost function, draw isoprofit curves
 
 3. Repersent market demand as a demand function
 
 4. Using the isoprofit curves and the market demand, find the profit maximizing price and output combination

---
## Cost Structure

### Understanding economies of scale

- Increasing returns to scale (Economies of scale):

 - `\(xF(K,AL) &lt; F(xK,xAL)\)`

 - If inputs increase by a given proportion, output increases more than proportionally

- Constant returns to scale:

 - `\(xF(K,AL) = F(xK,xAL)\)`

 - If inputs increase by a given proportion, output increases proportionally
 
- Decreasing returns to scale (Diseconomies of scale):

 - `\(xF(K,AL) &gt; F(xK,xAL)\)`

 - If inputs increase by a given proportion, output increases less than proportionally

---
### Economies of scale


.pull-left[
Potential causes

- Fixed cost of production

- Learning by doing

- Greater bargaining power

- Network effects


### Diseconomies of scale

Potential causes

- Additional layer of bureaucracy

- Harder to monitor employees

- Necessity of other departments

### Total cost of production and average cost of production

.pull-left[

### Marginal cost of production

.pull-left[
- Derivative of the total cost function, `\(MC\equiv\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ}=C'(Q)\)`
 
- Slope of the total cost curve at a given point point

- The effect on total cost of producing one more unit of output

- In this example, `\(MC\)` is increasing in `\(Q\)`

- `\(AC\)` is decreasing if `\(AC&lt;MC\)`

- `\(AC\)` is incresing if `\(AC&gt;MC\)`

- `\(AC\)` is at its minimum if `\(AC=MC\)`

### Isoprofit curves
.pull-left[
- Profit = Revenue - Cost 

$$
\pi = PQ-C(Q)=Q(P-AC)
$$
- An isoprofit curve represents all the price and quantity combinations which lead to same level of profit

- MC curve intersect with each isoprofit curve at its lowest point

- Average cost curve represents the 0 profit isoprofit curve

### Market demand

.pull-left[
- Represents the number of items consumers are willing to purchase at a given price.

 - Income of consumers
 
 - Price of other goods 
 
 - Utility consumers get from the consumption of the good

- Notice the upside down nature of the graph

 - The correct reading of this graph is that for a given price level, what the corresponding quantity demanded is.

### Production

.pull-left[

- Demand curve = Firm’s feasible frontier 
 
 - Slope = MRT
 
 - MRT: Marginal rate of transformation of lower prices into greater quantity sold
  

- Isoprofit curves = Firm’s indifference curves

 - Slope = MRS
 
 - MRS: Marginal rate of substitution in profit creation between selling more and chargin more

- Firm maximizes profits by choosing point where

   MRS = MRT 

 - Production takes place at point E

### Profit Maximization

.pull-left[

- Marginal revenue `\((MR)\)` = change in revenue from selling an aditional unit of output

$$

### Welfare analysis

.pull-left[
- Consumer surplus `\((CS)\)`: total difference between willingness to pay and actual price

- Producer surplus `\((PS)\)`: total difference between `\(MC\)` and actual price

- Total surplus (total gains from trade) = `\(CS + PS\)`

- Deadweight loss: A loss of gains from trade relative to the pareto optimal allocation `\(MC=P\)`
