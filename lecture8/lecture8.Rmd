- UK gdp per capita has grown substantially over the long-run

- The growth has not been smooth

### The business cycle



- Business cycle = Alternating periods of positive and negative growth rates.

### Measuring the aggregate economy

.pull-left[

<br>


- National accounts 
 
 - system used to measure overall output and expenditure in a country.

- 3 equivalent ways to measure GDP:

1. Total spending on domestic products

2. Total domestic production (measured as value added)

3. Total domestic income

### Components of GDP



.pull-left[

- Consumption (C)
 
 - Expenditure on consumer goods and services 

- Investment (I) 
 
 - Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (incl. equipment, buildings, and inventories = unsold output) 

- Government spending (G) 
 
 - Government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers to avoid double-counting)

- Net exports (trade balance) = Exports (X) minus imports (M)

$$ GDP = C + I + G + X – M $$ 

- (Also known as Y, or aggregate demand)

### Exports, imports, and government

- How do we account for international transactions?
 
 - e.g. if foreign production is domestic consumption (imports); 
 
 - if or domestic production is foreign consumption (exports)

- We include exports and exclude imports, so that GDP includes value added, income from, or consumption of, domestic production.

- How do we incorporate government?

 - Treat it as another producer – public services are “bought” via taxes

 - Assume that cost of production captures the value added

### Summary

- Economic growth is not a smooth process 

 - the economy goes through a business cycle

- System of national accounts to measure the economy

 - GDP = C + I + G + X – M
