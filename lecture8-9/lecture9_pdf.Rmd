### Measuring the aggregate economy


.pull-left[
- National accounts 
 
 - system used to measure overall output and expenditure in a country.

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Market value of all the goods and services produced within a country during a period of time.

- 3 equivalent ways to measure GDP:

-  _1. Spending:_ 
 
  - Total spending on domestic products 
 
  - By households, firms, the government, and the residents of other country's on domestic production
]
.pull-right[
- _2. Production:_ Total domestic production 

 - measured as value added
 
 - to constuct value added, cost of intermediate inputs must be substracted
 
 - value added is used (instead of gross output) to avoid double counting

- _3. Income:_ Total domestic income

 - wages, profits, incomes of the self-employed, taxes paid to government


]


---

### Circular flow model

.pull-left[
- You can measure GDP at the production stage, spending stage and income stage.

- All these approaches should give the same value

- Any spending on a good/service is an income to someone else

- Any spending on a good/service must be made to a good/service produced.

### Components of GDP




- Consumption $(C)$
 
 - Expenditure on consumer goods and services 
 
 - Goods are normally tangible things: cars, furniture, laptops,...

 - Services are normally intangible: transportation, housing, health care, 
 
- Investment $(I)$ 
 
 - Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (incl. equipment, buildings, and inventories = unsold output) 

- Government spending $(G)$ 
 
 - Government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers to avoid double-counting)

- Net exports (trade balance) = Exports $(X)$ minus imports $(M)$

$$ GDP = C + I + G + X – M $$ 

- GDP is also known as Y, or **aggregate demand**





---
### Exports, imports, and government

- How do we account for international transactions:
 
 - imports: domestic consumption of foreign production, 
 
 - exports: foreing consumption of domestic production?
 
- Exports are included:
 
 - because exports are domestic production

- Imports are excluded

 - because imports are foreign production
 
- **Net exports** = Exports - Imports

 - Also called **trade balance**

- How do we incorporate government?

 - Treat it as another producer – public services are “bought” via taxes

 - Assume that cost of production captures the value added

### Components of GDP, data

| | US | Eurozone | China |
| :--- | :---: | :---:|
| Consumption (C) |	68.4% |	55.9% |	37.3% |
| Government spending (G) |	15.1% |	21.1% |	14.1% |
| Investment (I) |	19.1% |	19.5% |	47.3% |
| Change in inventories | 	 0.4% |	 0.0% |	 2.0% |
| Exports (X) |	13.6% |	43.9% 	|26.2%|
| Imports (M) |	16.6% |	40.5% |	23.8%|

- In advanced economies, consumption is the largest component of GDP

- In China, investment is the largets component of GDP

- Share of investment in GDP is smaller in advanced economies
---
### Contributions of each component to change in GDP

percentage change in GDP = 

- percentage change in consumption $\times$ share of consumption in GDP 
$$ + $$
- percentage change in investment $\times$ share of investment in GDP
$$ + $$
- percentage change in government spending $\times$ share of government spending in GDP

$$ + $$

- percentage change in net exports $\times$ share of net exports in GDP

#### Contribution of components to US GDP growth
| 	|GDP| 	Consumption| 	Investment 	|Government spending |	Net exports|
|:---| :---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2009 |	−2.8 |	−1.06 | 	−3.52 |	0.64 | 	1.14 |

- Investment share is small, but it's contribution to growth is large.

### How do households cope with fluctuations

- Economies fluctuate between good and bad times

- To answer this question, first understand different kind of shocks

---
### Shocks

Shock = an unexpected event (such as extreme weather) which causes GDP to fluctuate.


There are two broad types of shocks:

- Good or bad fortune strikes the household
 
 - A disease affecting a family member
 
 - A family member losing a job
 
 - etc

- Good or bad fortune strikes the entire economy

 - Financial crisis
 
 - Large political crisis
 
 - Coronavirus 
 
 - etc


---
.pull-left[
### Household shocks

People use two strategies to deal with shocks that are specific to their household: 

1. Self-insurance 
 
 - saving and borrowing
 
 - Other households are not involved. 
 
 - Households want to smooth their consumption
 
  - Consumption too much later, and very little now is not desirable

2. Co-insurance 

 - support from social network 
 
 - households are to a degree alturistic
 
 - support from government (unemployment benefits).

]


.pull-right[
### Economy-wide shocks

- Co-insurance is less effective 

 - the bad shock hits everyone at the same time.

- But when these shocks hit, co-insurance is even more necessary.

- In farming economies of the past that were based in volatile climates, people practised co-insurance based on trust, reciprocity, and altruism.

### Why is consumption smooth?

.pull-left[

- Households make lifetime consumption plans based on 
  - expectations about the future 
  - react to shocks

- Readjust long-run consumption if shocks are permanent

- Do not change long-run consumption if shocks are temporary

- Suppose a worker expects a promototion in the future

- They will want to increase consumption now
 - Higher consumption than income now
 - Lower consumption than income when promoted
 - Higer consumption than income when retired
 


]

.pull-right[

<center>
<img src="./files/figure-13-10-c.jpg" width="100%"/>
</center>

- They achieve consumption smoothing by 
 - borrowing now, 
 - and saving and paying debts when promoted
 - consuming savings when retired
]

---
### Consumption smoothing and the aggregate economy

- Consumption smoothing is a basic source of stabilisation in an economy.

- Shocks will be dampened when households smooth their consumption

 - when they base their consumption on lifetime income 

- However, there are limits of consumption smoothing:

 - credit constraints
 
 - weakness of will
 
 - limited co-insurance

- Limits of consumption smoothing may amplify the initial shock.
 
- This helps us understand the business cycle and how to manage it. 


---
### Limits of consumption smoothing: credit constraints

.pull-left[

- Credit constraints – limits on amount borrowed/ability to borrow.

- The households unable to adjust to a temporary income shock have lower welfare.

- Suppose households are expecting in increase in income in the future

- Not credit constrained household can borrow and increase consumption now

- Credit constrained householf cannot borrow and consumes as much as household income

### Negative income shock

.pull-left[
- We can use two-period model analyze the effects of a negative income shock

- This household currently have an income of $y$ now and later

- It can borrow at an interest rate, $r$

- It choose to consume at point $A$

- Suppose its income now declines unanticipatedly

 - It earn $y' < y$ now, but its future income remains the same 
 
- If it cannot borrow, it will consume at point $A'$

- If it can borrow, it will consume at point $A''$

 - It trades later consumption for current consumption
 - It reaches higher utility level

</center>
]

---
### Limits of consumption smoothing: weakness of will

.pull-left[

- Weakness of will – inability to commit to beneficial future plans.

 - Becuase it requires sacrificies now
 
- Suppose this household is expecting a future reduction in income

- To smooth consumption it needs save now while having higher income

- If it does not save because of weakness of will, it may regret it later.

### Why is investment volatile?

- Firms don’t have preferences for smoothing like households. 

- Firms respond to innovations by investing in machines embedding new technology

 - Example: incorporation of ICT into production

 - If they don't invest to acquire new technology, they will lose market
 
 - Leads to clustering of innovation
 
 - Investment by one firm _pushes_ other firms to invest

- Investment by one firm may _pull_ other firms to invest

- Credit constraints may lead to clustering of innovation

 - If economy is in downturn and firms are not making enough profit, they cannot borrow to invest
 
- They adjust investment plans to both temporary and permanent shocks, to maximise their profits.  


---
### How one firms' investment decision affect another firm's investment decision

- Investment decisions depend on firms’ expectations about future demand  

- If one firm expects other firm to invest, it will also invest

 - High demand → high capacity utilisation →  investment → even higher demand

- If one firm expects other firm not to invest, it will not invest

- The result may be both firms investing, or both firms not investing

---
### Business confidence

- Business confidence coordinates investment decisions

---
### Investment and the aggregate economy 
.pull-left[

- The benefits of coordinating investment makes cycles self-reinforcing.

- Firms respond positively to the growth of demand in the economy.

- This is why investment is more volatile than GDP.

---
### Other components of GDP

- Government spending is less volatile than investment
    
 - does not depend on business confidence
 
 - large portion of government spending is nondiscretionary 

- Exports depend on demand from other countries, so will fluctuate according to the business cycles of major export markets.

### Inflation
.pull-left[

- Inflation = an increase in the general price level in the economy

- Inflation tends to be lower during recessions (high unemployment)

### Measuring inflation

- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures 
 - the general level of prices that consumers have to pay for goods and services, 
 - including consumption taxes

- CPI is baased on a representative bundle of consumer goods 
 - _cost of living_

- Common measure of inflation = change in CPI 

- GDP deflator = A measure of 
 
 - the level of prices for domestically produced output (ratio of nominal to real GDP) 

- GDP deflator tracks prices of components of GDP (C, I, G, NX)

- GDP deflator allows GDP to be compared across countries and over time


---
### Trends in inflation

- Upward spikes in inflation during economic crises

- general downward trend since 1970s

- inflation tends to be higher in poor than in rich countries



---
### Summary

- Economic growth is not a smooth process 
 
 - the economy goes through a business cycle

- Households try to smooth their consumption over the business cycle (problem: credit constraints)

- Investment is more volatile than GDP

- Inflation moves with the business cycle

- System of national accounts to measure the economy
 
  $$GDP = C + I + G + X – M$$
  
- Measuring GDP as income, spending, production
