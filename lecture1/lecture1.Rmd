### Microeconomics review 

<br>


We will learn

- how wages are determined within a firm,

- how prices are set when a firm has a price setting power,

- how prices are determined when each individual firm and each consumer has no power to set prices. 
---
### The labor market

<br>

We will learn

- economy wide determination of wages, employment, and the distribution of income 

- how wages and unemployment rate are related

- how wage setting and price setting processes jointy determine real wages and the level of unemployment in the economy

Had the productivity growth followed the trend, each person would have earned about 11% more now.

### The credit market

We will learn

- role of financial institutions on funneling consumer savings into investment

- principal agent problem in the borrowing-lending relationship

- the process of money creation

- the role of central banks

- determination of the interest rate charged by the banks

### Measuring income and living standards

<br>

<br>



- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) = A measure of total income and output of the economy in a given period.
Usually expressed in per-capita terms (as an average income).

- GDP per capita ≠ Disposable income

- Disposable income = Total income – taxes + government transfers

- Both are imperfect measures of well-being

### GDP per capita over time

### Timing of growth


<br>


- Growth take-off occurred at different points in time for different countries:

 - Britain was the first country to experience sustained economic growth. It began around 1650.
 
 - In Japan, it occurred around 1870.
 
 - The kink for China and India happened in the second half of the 20th century. 

- In some economies, substantial improvements in people’s living standards did not occur until they gained independence from colonial rule or interference by European nations.
