### Measuring income and living standards

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) = A measure of total income and output of the economy in a given period.
Usually expressed in per-capita terms (as an average income).

- GDP per capita ≠ Disposable income

- Disposable income = Total income – taxes + government transfers

- Both are imperfect measures of well-being

## Timing of growth

- Growth take-off occurred at different points in time for different countries:
 - Britain was the first country to experience sustained economic growth. It began around 1650.
 - In Japan, it occurred around 1870.
 - The kink for China and India happened in the second half of the 20th century. 

- In some economies, substantial improvements in people’s living standards did not occur until they gained independence from colonial rule or interference by European nations.
