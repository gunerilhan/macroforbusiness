### Definitions

- **Population of working age:** number of all the people aged between 15 and 64.

- **Labor force:** number of all the people in the working age who are working or seeking an employment outside of the household. 

- **Out of labor force:** number of working age people who are not working and not actively looking for a job

 - e.g. people unable to work due to sickness, stay at home parents to raise children, ...
 
- **Employed:** number of people that have a job

- **Unemployed:** number of people that does not have a job but actively seeking for one

### Recall what we learned in the previous lectures

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


At the firm level

- Wage setting: firms set wage sufficiently high to motivate employees to exert high effort   

- Price setting: firms set a markup above the marginal cost of production to maximize profits  

---
### The chain of firm decisions

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

Nominal wage = f(other firms’ prices and wages, unemployment rate)
  
   $$ \Downarrow$$

Price = f(&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;own nominal wage&lt;/span&gt;, demand for own product)

$$ \Downarrow$$

Output = f(optimal &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;, demand curve)

$$ \Downarrow$$

Number of employees = f(&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;ouput&lt;/span&gt;, production function)

&lt;/center&gt;

- Notice that unemployment rate, input to the nominal wage function, depends on the number of employees function.

 - Hence macroeconomics: actions/decisions of all agents in the economy are interrelated.

---
### Goal of this lecture

Characterize

- real wage = `\(W/P\)` in the entire economy

 - `\(W\)` is the nominal wage, `\(P\)` is the price level of a representative bundle of goods in the economy
 
 - What workers care about is the what they can purchase with their salaries

- level of employment in the entire economy

&lt;br&gt;

To achieve this goal

1. derive the wage-setting curve in the entire economy

2. derive the price-setting curve in the entire economy

3. put them together to get the equilibrium

### Deriving the wage-setting curve 

- As unemployment decreases 

 - workers are more likely to find a job elsewhere had they lose their job
 
 - results in lower employment rents
 
 - to keep workers motivated, firms raise wages
 
 - hence there is a positive relationship between employment and real wages

- &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;In the last seminar I overcomplicated this graph.&lt;/span&gt;

 - &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Assume workers' best response curve have characteristics that a rightward shift always leads to an increase in the wage rate.&lt;/span&gt;

### Deriving the price-setting

- Given a firm's own wage and the demand for own product, the marketing department sets the prices

- Given the price chosen by the marketing department, production department sets the quantity

- Given production, HR hires workers


Using these decisions, we will derive the price-setting curve.
### Assumptions 

- Labor is the only factor of production

- One unit of labor produces `\(\lambda\)` units of output

 - Constant marginal cost of production
 
 - Marginal cost of production is equal to wage rate over labor productivity, `\(W/\lambda\)`
 
- All firms face the same demand curve



---
### Price Setting curve

.pull-left[
- To maximize profits, the firm produces at point B.

- Markup, `\(\mu\equiv\frac{p^\ast-MC}{p^\ast} = \frac{p^\ast-W/\lambda}{p^\ast}\)`, where `\(p^\ast\)` is the firm price

 - Markup is a measure of market power
 
 - Contrast this with a competitive market in which `\(p^\ast=MC\)`, and hence firms don't have any market power
 
- Since all firms face the same demand curve, they all charge the same price, hence `\(p^\ast=P\)`, where `\(P\)` is the price of a bundle of the goods in the economy.

$$ \mu  = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P} $$

&lt;img src="./lecture5_files/figure-html/Slide8.JPG" width="120%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

]

---


### Price setting

- We assume that the markup, `\(\mu\)`, is determined by the market conditions such

 - level of competetition in the market
 
 - elasticity of demand
 
- Then `\(\mu  = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P} = 1 - \frac{W}{P} \frac{1}{\lambda} \Rightarrow \frac{W}{P}=\lambda - \lambda \mu\)`

- Real wage, `\(\frac{W}{P} = \lambda - \lambda \mu\)`, is independent of the employment level

- Real wage is positively related to labor productivity, and inversely related to market power.

- To better understand this point, read

### Price-setting curve

- It's actually a point (or flat line independent of employment level)

- Given a wage rate, all firms charge a price `\(P\)` such that `\(W/P\)` is equal to a constant that is determined by factors such as
 - consumer preferences 
 - level of competition
 - labor productivity

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./lecture5_files/figure-html/Slide9.JPG" width="60%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

### Price-setting curve, cont'd

- At point A, real wage is high, and output is high
 - Given demand, firms raise prices, output decreases, but profits increase.
 - Economy moves towards point B
 
- At point C, real wage is low, and output is low
 - Given demand, firms decreases prices, output increases, but profits increase.
 - Economy moves towards B

### Labor market equilibrium

.pull-left[
- Intersection of the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve gives the Nash equilibrium.
 
 - Point `\(X\)` in the graph
 - Firms pay the smallest wage to make workers exert sufficient effort
 - Given the wage, employment is at the highest level
 - Workers cannot ask more (firms will not pay more)
 - Workers cannot put less effort (they will lose their jobs)
 - Unemployed people cannot pursuade firms to hire them
 - Firms cannot improve their profit by paying less wage or charging more.
 
- In equilibrium, there is unemployment

- In equilibrium, real wage is lower than labor productivity

### Adjustment process of the economy


.pull-left[
- After the reduction in demand, the economy is at the point `\(B\)`.
 - Notice that, there is no change in the real wage
 - There is no change in the nominal wage yet
 - There is no change in the prices yet
 - Given the wage rate, `\(p^\ast\)` is the optimal price for the firm
 
- Then HR department lowers wages thinking that with higher unemployment, lower wages will still motivate workers to exert enough effort

- Isoprot curves become steeper
 - The slope of the isoprofit curve is `\(\frac{P-W/\lambda}{Q}\)`
 - As `\(W\)` decreases, isoprofit curve becomes steeper

### Adjustment process of the economy, cont'd

.pull-left[
- With the reduced wage, `\(B\)` is no longer the profit maximizing point

- The firm chooses point `\(X\)` to maximize profit
 - Price goes down to `\(p^{\ast \ast}\)`
 - Lower prices leads to higher quantity demanded, `\(q^{\ast \ast}\)`
 
- At the new equilibrium
 - real wage is still unchanged
 - unemployment is unchanged
 - wage and prices are lower

### Government intervention


.pull-left[

Governmensts can react to reduction in demand by

- fiscal policy
  - increasing spending or reducing taxes
  
- monetary policy
 - reducing interest rates to promote investment and durable goods consumption

- These policies will shift up the demand

### Distribution of income

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./lecture5_files/figure-html/figure-09-16.jpg" width="60%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- This model has implications on the distribution of income in the economy.

- There are there groups:
 
 - unemployed: 10% and earn nothing
 - employed: 80% and earn 60% of total income
 - firm owners: 10% and earn 40% of total income

- Share of income going to emloyees is determined by the real wage over productivity ratio: `\(\frac{\frac{W}{P}}{\lambda}\)`

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./lecture5_files/figure-html/figure-09-17-a.jpg" width="60%"/&gt;

- We can draw lorenz curve and calculate the gini coefficient.

### Labor market policies

- Shifts in the price-setting curve:

 - Education &amp; training: labor productivity `\(\uparrow\)`

 - Wage subsidy: Production costs and prices `\(\downarrow\)`

- Shifts in the wage-setting curve:

 - Lower unemployment benefit: reservation wage `\(\downarrow\)`

- Shifts in labour supply curve: 

 - immigration policies: labour supply `\(\uparrow\)`

 - childcare provision: female labour participation `\(\uparrow\)`

### Price-setting curve, [mathematical](./lecture5.html#back-normal)


.pull-left[
- Recall that at the optimum, slope of the isoprofit curve (MRS) is equal to the slope of the demand curve (MRT)


- Write down the slope of the demand curve as a function of elasticity

$$ \epsilon = -\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}} = -\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\frac{P}{Q}$$
`$$MRT \equiv -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = \frac{P}{Q} \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$`
- Then write down MRS, say, at the `\(\pi=k\)` isoprofit line 

`$$P*Q - Q*AC = k$$` 

- Differentiate alongside this curve

`$$dP*Q+P*dQ-dQ*AC = 0$$`

]
.pull-right[

`$$dP*Q -dQ(P-AC) = 0$$`

`$$MRS=\frac{dP}{dQ}=\frac{P-AC}{Q}=\frac{P-W/\lambda}{Q}$$`
since average cost of production is equal to marginal cost (in this economy with cost unit costs), which is equal to `\(W/\lambda\)`

- In optimum, `\(MRS=MRT\)`

`$$\frac{P-W/\lambda}{Q}=\frac{P}{Q} \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$`
Then

`$$\mu = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P}= \frac{1}{\epsilon} \Rightarrow \frac{W}{P} = \lambda - \frac{\lambda}{\epsilon}$$`
- Real wage is positively related to elasticity of substituion, but independent of employment
