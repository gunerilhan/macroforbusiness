### Definitions

- **Population of working age:** number of all the people aged between 15 and 64.

- **Labor force:** number of all the people in the working age who are working or seeking an employment outside of the household. 

- **Out of labor force:** number of working age people who are not working and not actively looking for a job

 - e.g. people unable to work due to sickness, stay at home parents to raise children, ...
 
- **Employed:** number of people that have a job

- **Unemployed:** number of people that does not have a job but actively seeking for one

### Labor force participation rate (LFPR)

### Recall what we learned in the previous lectures

<br>

<br>


At the firm level

- Wage setting: firms set wage sufficiently high to motivate employees to exert high effort   

- Price setting: firms set a markup above the marginal cost of production to maximize profits  

---
### The chain of firm decisions

<br>

<center>

Nominal wage = f(other firmsâ€™ prices and wages, unemployment rate)
  
   $$ \Downarrow$$

Price = f(<span style="color:red">own nominal wage</span>, demand for own product)

$$ \Downarrow$$

Output = f(optimal <span style="color:red">price</span>, demand curve)

$$ \Downarrow$$

Number of employees = f(<span style="color:red">ouput</span>, production function)

</center>

- Notice that unemployment rate, input to the nominal wage function, depends on the number of employees function.

 - Hence macroeconomics: actions/decisions of all agents in the economy are interrelated.

---
### Goal of this lecture

Characterize

- real wage = $W/P$ in the entire economy

 - $W$ is the nominal wage, $P$ is the price level of a representative bundle of goods in the economy
 
 - What workers care about is the what they can purchase with their salaries

- level of employment in the entire economy

<br>

To achieve this goal

1. derive the wage-setting curve in the entire economy

2. derive the price-setting curve in the entire economy

3. put them together to get the equilibrium

### Deriving the wage-setting curve 

- As unemployment decreases 

 - workers are more likely to find a job elsewhere had they lose their job
 
 - results in lower employment rents
 
 - to keep workers motivated, firms raise wages
 
 - hence there is a positive relationship between employment and real wages

- <span style="color:red">In the last seminar I overcomplicated this graph.</span>

 - <span style="color:red">Assume workers' best response curve have characteristics that a rightward shift always leads to an increase in the wage rate.</span>

### Wage-setting curve
.pull-left[

- **Wage-setting curve** shows the real wage necessary to keep workers motivated at each level of economy-wide employment.

- At a given real wage, the distance between the corresponding employment rate and the labor force is the unemployment rate (times the labor force participation rate)

 - Example, at real wage = $w_L$. the unemployment rate is equal to 12%.

- As unemployment rate decreases, real wage increases.

### Deriving the price-setting

- Given a firm's own wage and the demand for own product, the marketing department sets the prices

- Given the price chosen by the marketing department, production department sets the quantity

- Given production, HR hires workers


Using these decisions, we will derive the price-setting curve.
### Assumptions 

- Labor is the only factor of production

- One unit of labor produces $\lambda$ units of output

 - Constant marginal cost of production
 
 - Marginal cost of production is equal to wage rate over labor productivity, $W/\lambda$
 
- All firms face the same demand curve



---
### Price Setting curve

.pull-left[
- To maximize profits, the firm produces at point B.

- Markup, $\mu\equiv\frac{p^\ast-MC}{p^\ast} = \frac{p^\ast-W/\lambda}{p^\ast}$, where $p^\ast$ is the firm price

 - Markup is a measure of market power
 
 - Contrast this with a competitive market in which $p^\ast=MC$, and hence firms don't have any market power
 
- Since all firms face the same demand curve, they all charge the same price, hence $p^\ast=P$, where $P$ is the price of a bundle of the goods in the economy.

$$ \mu  = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P} $$

### Price setting

- We assume that the markup, $\mu$, is determined by the market conditions such

 - level of competetition in the market
 
 - elasticity of demand
 
- Then $\mu  = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P} = 1 - \frac{W}{P} \frac{1}{\lambda} \Rightarrow \frac{W}{P}=\lambda - \lambda \mu$

- Real wage, $\frac{W}{P} = \lambda - \lambda \mu$, is independent of the employment level

- Real wage is positively related to labor productivity, and inversely related to market power.

### Price-setting curve

- It's actually a point (or flat line independent of employment level)

- Given a wage rate, all firms charge a price $P$ such that $W/P$ is equal to a constant that is determined by factors such as
 - consumer preferences 
 - level of competition
 - labor productivity

### Price-setting curve, cont'd

- At point A, real wage is high, and output is high
 - Given demand, firms raise prices, output decreases, but profits increase.
 - Economy moves towards point B
 
- At point C, real wage is low, and output is low
 - Given demand, firms decreases prices, output increases, but profits increase.
 - Economy moves towards B

### Labor market equilibrium

.pull-left[
- Intersection of the wage-setting curve and price-setting curve gives the Nash equilibrium.
 
 - Point $X$ in the graph
 - Firms pay the smallest wage to make workers exert sufficient effort
 - Given the wage, employment is at the highest level
 - Workers cannot ask more (firms will not pay more)
 - Workers cannot put less effort (they will lose their jobs)
 - Unemployed people cannot pursuade firms to hire them
 - Firms cannot improve their profit by paying less wage or charging more.
 
- In equilibrium, there is unemployment

- In equilibrium, real wage is lower than labor productivity

### Price-setting curve, [mathematical](./lecture5.html#back-normal)


.pull-left[
- Recall that at the optimum, slope of the isoprofit curve (MRS) is equal to the slope of the demand curve (MRT)


- Write down the slope of the demand curve as a function of elasticity

$$ \epsilon = -\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}} = -\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\frac{P}{Q}$$
$$MRT \equiv -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} = \frac{P}{Q} \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$
- Then write down MRS, say, at the $\pi=k$ isoprofit line 

$$P*Q - Q*AC = k$$ 

- Differentiate alongside this curve

$$dP*Q+P*dQ-dQ*AC = 0$$

]
.pull-right[

$$dP*Q -dQ(P-AC) = 0$$

$$MRS=\frac{dP}{dQ}=\frac{P-AC}{Q}=\frac{P-W/\lambda}{Q}$$
since average cost of production is equal to marginal cost (in this economy with cost unit costs), which is equal to $W/\lambda$

- In optimum, $MRS=MRT$

$$\frac{P-W/\lambda}{Q}=\frac{P}{Q} \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$
Then

$$\mu = \frac{P-W/\lambda}{P}= \frac{1}{\epsilon} \Rightarrow \frac{W}{P} = \lambda - \frac{\lambda}{\epsilon}$$
- Real wage is positively related to elasticity of substituion, but independent of employment
