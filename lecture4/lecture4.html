## Environment

&lt;br&gt;




- There are many firms producing the **same** product

- There are many buyers

- Each firm's decisions are affected by behavior of competing firms 

- Each firm cannot invidually affect the decisions of the othe firms

- Participants in the market are price takers

 - If a seller asks a price higher than the market, no one will buy from them
 
 - If a buyer offers a price lower than the market, no one will sell to them
 
&gt; **Competitive equilibrium:** "A market outcome in which all buyers and sellers are price-takers, and at the prevailing market price, the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded". &amp;ndash; Core the Economy

## Market demand 
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;


- **Demand curve:** represents the total quantity that all consumers are willing to buy at a given price

 - _Be careful:_ The graph reads as that given the price, what is the amount that consumers demand, not the other way around.

- Represents the **willingness to pay (WTP)** of buyers

- Example: secondhand textbook market

## Market supply
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- **Supply curve:** represents the total quantity that all firms together are willing to sell at a given price

 - _Be careful:_ The graph reads as that given the price, what is the amount that producer supply to the market, not the other way around.


- Represents the **willingness to accept (WTA)** of sellers

- Sellers may have different **reservation prices.**

## Equilibrium
.pull-left[

- The market clears at the equilibrium price

 - At the equilibrium price, 
 
 quantity demanded = quantity supplied
 
- Any other point is not Nash equilibrium.

 - At `\(P &gt; P^\ast\)`, there will be excess supply
 
 - Some sellers will benefit from charging lower prices
 
 - At `\(P &lt; P^\ast\)`, there will  be excess demand
 
 - Sellers knows that price will go up, they will wait and not sell at `\(P &lt; P^\ast\)`.

## Price taking firms
.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;

 - Price taking firms

  - cannot benefit from charging a different price than the market price
 
  - cannot influence the market
 
- Demand curve for an individual firm is completely flat

 - Demand for a firm's product at prices greater than the market price, `\(P^\ast\)`, will be zero.

## Price taking firms, profit maximizatin
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Given price, the firm will chose the quantity

 - Firm will produce at the highest isoprofit curve in the feasible set 
 
 - Highest feasible isoprofit curve is tangent to the demand curve
 
 - Marginal cost curve intersects with the isoprofit curves at their lowest point
 
 - MC passes through the tangency point of highest feasible isoprofit curve and  the demand curve
]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="./lecture4_files/figure-html/Slide6.JPG" width="120%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

]

---

## A firm's supply curve
.pull-left[


- Supply curve = Marginal cost curve

- For a given price, profit maximizing quantity is where the highest feasible isoprofit curve is tangent to feasible set.

 - The tangency points is where MC intersects with the isoprofit curve

- If you trace out profit maximizing quantities for each price, you get the marginal cost curve

- _Be careful:_ The correct interpration of supply curve = MC is that given a price level, firms will produce the amount at which marginal cost is equal to price.

- Firms might be making a loss in the short run 
 
 - They will remain in the market if future profit perspectives are better.

## Firm and market supply curve
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- By horizontally summing the firm market supply curve, we will get the market supply curve

- Market supply curve is the market marginal cost curve

## Gains from trade
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Consumer surplus = the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay

- Producer surplus = the differnece between what producers are willing to accept and they they are actually paid

- Gains from trade = consumer surplus + producer surplus

## Deadweight loss
.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;



- Suppose the total quantity sold is less than competitive equilibrium level

- The reduction in the total surplus is called deadweight loss

## Positive demand shock

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;


- Suppose the incoming class size went up

- Demand will shift to the right

- Excess demand will drive up the prices

- New equilibrium will be on point B

 - Price and quantity will go up

- Movement along the supply curve

 - Quantity supplied will increase
 
 - No change in the supply

---
## Positive supply shock

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

- Suppose firms became more productive as a result of technological progress

- Supply curve will shift to the right

- Excess supply will push down the prices

- Price will go down, quantity wil go up

- Movement along the demand curve

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./lecture4_files/figure-html/Slide13.JPG" width="120%"/&gt;

## Firm entry

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


- Suppose more firms enter to the market

- Supply will shift to the right

## Tax

.pull-left[

- Suppose the government imposes a proportional tax on a product

- This will shift up (left) the supply curve

 - What matters for the sellers is what remains to them, not what consumers pay
 
- The new equilibrium point is B

 - The difference between `\(P_1\)` and `\(P_0\)` is the amount of tax.

 - Consumers pay higher than what they used to pay
 
 - Seller receive less than what they used to receive

## Tax

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;

&gt; **Tax incidence:** The effect of tax on welfare of consumers and producers &amp;ndash; Core the Economy 

- Tax reduces the consumer surplus

- Tax reduces the producer surplus

- Reduction in consumer surplus plus the producer surplus is greater than the tax revenue

- Tax creates deadweight loss

- Total social cost of tax depends on where the tax revenue is used.

## Perfect competition

&lt;br&gt;

A perfectly competitive market has the following properties:

- Homogeneous (identical) goods/services are exchanged.

- Very large number of potential buyers and sellers
 
 - Each buyer/seller is very small relative to the market

- Buyers and sellers all act independently of one another

 - No cartels / no coordination

- Price information easily available to buyers and sellers

 - If someone is selling a good at different price, everyone knows about this.
---
## Characteristics of perfect competition

&lt;br&gt;

- **Law of One Price:** All transactions take place at a single price.

- At that price, the market clears (supply = demand).

- Buyers and sellers are all price-takers.

- All potential gains from trade are realized.

- Perfect competition may not hold completely in reality, but can be a good approximation to actual firm behaviour.


---
## Evidence of perfect competition?
&lt;br&gt;

Economists have used two tests for competitive equilibrium:

1. Do all trades take place at the same price?

2. Are firms selling goods at a price equal to marginal cost?

It is hard to find examples of perfect competition:

- Even when consumers can easily check the price of products (online shopping sites), prices of the same product differ.

- Fulton Fish Market study – within the same market, prices of the same fish product differed for different customer types.

## Price-setters vs. Price-takers
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

|Price-setters (Monopoly) | Price-takers (Perfect Competition) |
|:--- |:---|
| MC &lt; Price | MC = Price|
|Deadweight losses (Pareto inefficient) | No deadweight losses (can be Pareto efficient) |
| Owners receive economic rents in both long- and short-run | No economic rents in the long-run |
| Firms advertise their unique product | Little advertising expenditure |
| Firms invest in R&amp;D, seek to prevent copying | Little incentive for innovation |
